      </h3>
      <p> There were two main motivations for this 3-weeks-long project:
      <ol>
        <li>A few weeks ago we found a small, 9 mm in diameter, glass sphere. Wouldn't be could to include a POV system inside of it?</li>
        <li>There is a 3D printed contest!
      </ol>
      Here are the results of 3 weeks of hard work. I'll try to cover it as much as possible, including pictures and videos. It will go from the CAD design to the assembly and programming.

      If you have any comments, you can reach me <a href=https://twitter.com/mdbLabs>@mdblabs</a>. Enjoy!

      </h3>
        Main idea was simple: just make a rotating sphere, holding from a brushless motor, on a base. Main problem on POV systems is how to provide the rotating part power. Normally,
        two solutions are implemented: battery powered or power transmission to the rotating part by any means.

        While I didn't want to use any battery (just keep the gadget connected to the AC mains), I thought about power transmission on brushed motors. I will use a brushless motor to move the sphere,
        and a brush contact to power it. Nice!

        The main idea was to have a squared based, holding all the electronics and the PSU plus the sphere. Everything should be inside an enclosure. Also, as we had a 9 cm in dimater crystal sphere, electronics shoud
        be keep inside it.

        I made a few sketches and renders. They looked nice, so, I keep myself working on those ideas.

        </figure>

        Then, I mode a base, the brushless motor and the PSU. Motor was a small one: the <a href="http://rctimer.com/product-108.html">2204 1400 KV model from RC Timer </a> with its 10 A ESC.

        To hold the electronics, a support was designed to fit the Arduino/Genuino MKR1000. A second problem on the POVs is how to send not only power,
        but data to the rotating part. <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMKR1000">MKR1000</a> was an-easy to use, full-solution, which includes enough pins, plus a built-in wireless modem.

        </figure>

        Then, a pair of arms were designed to hold the LEDs: one for the red ones, and a the other one for the greens. Original idea was to use 3 colors, but that would make the desing very complex. Also, using
        just two arms will keep the rotating part balanced.
