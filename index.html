      </h3>
      <p> There were two main motivations for this 3-weeks-long project:
      <ol>
        <li>A few weeks ago we found a small, 9 mm in diameter, glass sphere. Wouldn't be could to include a POV system inside of it?</li>
        <li>There is a 3D printed contest!
      </ol>
        <p>Here are the results of 3 weeks of hard work. I'll try to cover it as much as possible, including pictures and videos. It will go from the CAD design to the assembly and programming.</p>

        <p>If you have any comments, you can reach me <a href=https://twitter.com/mdbLabs target="_blank">@mdblabs</a>. Enjoy!</p>

        <a id="3D Design" class="anchor" href="#3d-design" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3D Design<sup>*</sup>
      </h3>
        <p>Main idea was simple: just make a rotating sphere, holding from a brushless motor, on a base. Main problem on POV systems is how to provide the rotating part power. Normally,
        two solutions are implemented: battery powered or power transmission to the rotating part by any means.</p>

        <p>While I didn't want to use any battery (just keep the gadget connected to the AC mains), I thought about power transmission on brushed motors. I will use a brushless motor to move the sphere,
        and a brush contact to power it. Nice!</p>

        <p> Having a squared based, holding all the electronics and the PSU plus the sphere was the plan. Everything should be inside an enclosure. Also, as we had a 9 cm in diameter crystal sphere, electronics shoud
        be fit inside of it.</p>

        <p>I made a few sketches and renders. They looked nice, so, I kept myself working on those ideas.</p>

            <figcaption > Fig.1-One of the first idea renders.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Then, I modeled the base, the brushless motor and the PSU. Motor was a small one: the <a href="http://rctimer.com/product-108.html" target="_blank">2204 1400 KV model from RC Timer </a> with its 10 A ESC.</p>

        <p>To hold the electronics, a support was designed to fit the Arduino/Genuino MKR1000. A second problem on the POVs is how to send not only power,
        but data to the rotating part. <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMKR1000" target="_blank">MKR1000</a> was an-easy to use, full-solution, which includes enough pins, plus a built-in wireless modem.</p>

            <figcaption > Fig.2-Details of motor design and Arduino's support.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>A pair of arms were designed to hold the LEDs: one for the red ones, and a the other one for the greens. Original idea was to use 3 colors, but that would make the desing very complex. Also, using
        just two arms will keep the rotating part balanced. Also, a cylindrical column was included. This column will keep the arms straight during rotation, and will hold a pair of slots. On those slots
        a 5 mm copper film will be glued, to transmit power to the sphere. On each arm, a pair of spring based carbon brushes will make contact with the copper. An external, screwed ring, will hold everything tight</p>

        <p>Two more small arms were designed to carry a IR sensor, to measure half rotation. Also, on the base, a column with a thin plate will act as optical interrupt.</p>

            <figcaption > Fig.3-Arms detail.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Finally, a control panel and top and lateral panels were included. It has a AC connector, two LEDs (power ON and rotation indicator) and two switches: Power ON/OFF and Rotation ON/OFF.</p>

        <p><sup>*</sup> CAD design was done using <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview"  target="_blank">Autodesk Fusion 360.</a>

        </h3>

        <p>Several prototypes were printed, in order to adjust final design, like sphere or sensor arms. Also, to adjust tolerances for screw holes and assembly joins.</p>

        <p>Little sanding was only necessary on optical switch column, to let the IR sensor pass trought (see Electronics and Lesson Learned), although tolerances for werent good enought and was deprecated.</p>

        <p>List of printed parts is:</p>
